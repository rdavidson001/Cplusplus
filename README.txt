During my time within my software development lifecycle, I end up asking many questions. Some of these questions were answered
within my reading, but some I had to make connections throughout the entire course in order to find answers. One question 
that I had from the beginning was how to interpret the needs of users and how to implement them into my program. After learning
more about the process of the development of software and the agile methodology, I have found an answer. A very important step
in the process is speaking with the client and better understanding the image of the client. User stories allow for better detailed
images for the creation of the product for the client. 
Another question was how to approach future projects that I would be apart of. When thinking about the project, I believe it depends
on how big the project is, along with the amount of time we would have as a dead line. The shorter the project, the more I would want
to lean towards and agile approach. With a smaller project, less planning time would be needed and it would come with less risk
overall. As the project moved forward, back tracking phases within the project would be ideal. The higher amount of adaptability 
would mean higher chances of success, with a more accurate representation of what the client was imagining as their final product. 
During my time in future projects, it is very important that I keep in mind what a good team member means. This is represented by someone
who will keep constant communication with evryone else in the team, and thinks about overall effects to the team when making decisions. There
could be one person in the team that has more knowledge than everyone else, but it doesn't mean anything if that effort is not put
forth to help the entire team out.
